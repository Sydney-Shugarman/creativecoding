The bears eyes will be slowing moving back and forth showing a eye-like motion.
There will be a pink button in the left top corner. This button will allow you to hover over it and a crown will appear when your cursor is on top of the button. Thank the crown will dissepear once the cursor is moved away from the button.
The background of the canvas will be black with confetti slowly falling down. The confetti can be moved once the mouse is pressed and than more confetting will continue to loop the whole time.
