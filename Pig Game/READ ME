For my final project, after several attempts of the multiple ideas that I had.
I decided to lean towards more of a children's game. One that any that would be targeted
towards any age demographic. The object of the game is trying to block Mr. Pig into a area of the game board by
using single unit boxes. The directions of the game are on the top of the screen easily visible
for players to find and know how to play the game.
